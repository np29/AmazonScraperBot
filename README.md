# AmazonScraperBot
We are creating a bot that enters someone's amazon account into amazon giveaways by itself. The bot will be signing into a user's amazon account then it will scroll through each one of the 200 pages of the giveaways and enter the user for the giveaway. If by any chance the user wins the product, the bot will check if the user wantes to reveive this product. If the user does not want the product then the bot will remove the product.
